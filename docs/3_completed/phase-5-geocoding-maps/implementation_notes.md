# Geocoding & Maps Feature Implementation Notes

This document tracks the implementation progress, technical decisions, and challenges encountered during the development of the Geocoding & Maps feature.

## Technical Decisions

### Mapping Provider

- **Decision**: Using Mapbox GL JS and Mapbox Geocoding API as specified in the design document
- **Rationale**: Better performance with WebGL, more customizable styling, and better cost structure at scale

### API Key Management

- **Strategy**: Following 12-factor app methodology with environment variables
- **Implementation**: Using Next.js environment variables with proper client/server separation

### Rate Limiting

- **Approach**: Standard rate limiting strategy with plans to implement caching in the future
- **Implementation**: Will monitor API usage and implement rate limiting if needed

### Fallback Mechanisms

- **Primary**: Client-side Mapbox Geocoding API
- **Secondary**: Server-side Mapbox Geocoding API
- **Tertiary**: Manual coordinate entry by users

### Address Validation

- **Method**: Using Mapbox SDK for validation and normalization
- **Implementation**: Server-side validation before storing in database

## Implementation Progress

### Setup and Configuration

- Status: Completed
- Notes:
  - Installed Mapbox GL JS and Mapbox SDK dependencies
  - Created environment variable configuration (.env.local.example)
  - Set up TypeScript types for Mapbox components

### Address Autocomplete Component

- Status: Completed
- Notes:
  - Created AddressAutocomplete component with Mapbox Geocoding API integration
  - Implemented dropdown suggestions with real-time search
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Created demo page for component testing

### Map Picker Component

- Status: Completed
- Notes:
  - Created MapPicker component with Mapbox GL JS
  - Implemented draggable marker functionality
  - Added zoom controls and coordinate display
  - Created demo page for component testing

### Server-side Geocoding Service

- Status: Completed
- Notes:
  - Created GeocodeService module with Mapbox integration
  - Implemented address validation and normalization
  - Added API route for server-side geocoding fallback
  - Error handling and fallback mechanisms in place

### Database and API Integration

- Status: Partially completed
- Notes:
  - Created API endpoints for geocoding operations
  - Server-side validation implemented
  - Database schema updates still needed for Run model

### Form Integration

- Status: Completed
- Notes:
  - Created complete run creation form at /runs/new
  - Integrated AddressAutocomplete and MapPicker components
  - Implemented proper data flow and form validation
  - Added error handling and user feedback
  - Form successfully submits to existing API endpoints

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Missing shadcn/ui Components

- **Issue**: The project didn't have Combobox, Command, Popover, and Dialog components needed for AddressAutocomplete
- **Solution**: Implemented these components from scratch following shadcn/ui patterns and installed required dependencies

### Challenge: Mapbox Integration Complexity

- **Issue**: Mapbox GL JS requires careful handling of map initialization and cleanup
- **Solution**: Used useEffect hooks with proper cleanup and ref management to prevent memory leaks

### Challenge: Component Synchronization

- **Issue**: Keeping AddressAutocomplete and MapPicker components in sync
- **Solution**: Implemented controlled components with shared state management in parent forms

## Testing Notes

- Created comprehensive demo pages for each component
- Tested components in isolation and in combination
- Verified API integration with existing backend endpoints
- All components compile and render successfully

## Performance Considerations

- Implemented debounced API calls for address autocomplete (300ms delay)
- Used lazy loading for map components to reduce initial bundle size
- Added loading states to improve perceived performance

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for all components
- Implement caching for geocoding results
- Add rate limiting protection for API endpoints
- Consider adding offline support for maps
- Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
