This completed phase focused on the foundational tooling and project setup for a new web application, "hashhub-web". The core deliverables included bootstrapping a Next.js project, specifically pinning it to version 15.3.2, and integrating key frontend and backend technologies.

On the frontend side, the setup involved installing and configuring Tailwind CSS version 4 for styling, including the creation of a config file and updating content paths. Additionally, shadcn/ui was added and initialized, with a note to select common components like Buttons, Forms, and Cards, and to audit/tweak the theme tokens.

For the backend and data layer, the project incorporated Prisma as the ORM and PostgreSQL as the database. This involved installing Prisma client and CLI, initializing Prisma, and configuring the database connection URL in the environment file. This phase successfully established the essential technical stack and initial project structure.
