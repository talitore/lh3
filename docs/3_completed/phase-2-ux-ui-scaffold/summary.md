# UX/UI Scaffold – Completion Summary

The UX/UI Scaffold feature establishes the foundational user interface and experience structure for the application. Its primary purpose is to provide a robust, extensible, and accessible layout and design system that supports future development and prototyping of UI components. The feature delivers a global layout with a modern, collapsible overlay sidebar (Option 2), a fixed header with navigation, and a flexible main content area. The sidebar includes sections for "Upcoming Events," "Quick Stats," and "Admin Tools," and is designed to be responsive and accessible across devices.

A key outcome is the extension of shadcn's Tailwind tokens to define a custom color palette, spacing, and typography, forming the basis of a reusable design system. The feature includes the creation of common UI components—Card, Badge, Button, Input, MapEmbed, and PhotoGallery—each styled with Tailwind CSS and built for accessibility. A sandbox area in the app allows for isolated development and demonstration of these components, intentionally opting out of Storybook in favor of in-app demo pages. Notable design decisions include prioritizing a light, professional theme, a focus on accessibility, and a workflow that supports rapid prototyping and iteration.
