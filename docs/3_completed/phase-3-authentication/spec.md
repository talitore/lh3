### Feature Functionality and Technical Scope

The primary goal of this feature is to integrate NextAuth into the application to handle user authentication. This involves:

1.  **Installation and Setup**: Add `next-auth` as a project dependency.
2.  **Configuration**: Create the NextAuth API route (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`) and configure it with the Google OAuth provider. This will require obtaining Google API credentials (client ID and secret) from the Google Cloud Console.
3.  **API Route Protection**: Utilize `getServerSession` within API route handlers to check for an active user session. If no session exists or the session is invalid, the API should return an unauthorized error (e.g., HTTP 401).
4.  **Client-Side Authentication State**: Implement mechanisms on the client-side to manage and display authentication status (e.g., showing a login button if unauthenticated, or user information if authenticated). This might involve using NextAuth's `useSession` hook or `getSession` function.

### UI Treatments / Layout Options

#### Option 1: Prominent Sign-In Button in Header

- **Description**: A clearly visible "Sign in with Google" button is placed in the application header/navigation bar. Upon clicking, the user is redirected to the Google OAuth consent screen. After successful authentication, the button is replaced with the user's profile picture or name, possibly with a dropdown for accessing account settings or a sign-out option.
- **Pros**: Standard, easily recognizable pattern. Simple for users to understand and access.
- **Cons**: If the header is already crowded, adding another button might clutter the UI.

#### Option 2: Dedicated Sign-In Page

- **Description**: A dedicated route (e.g., `/auth/signin`) hosts the "Sign in with Google" button. Users attempting to access protected resources are redirected to this page. The page could also include branding or information about the application.
- **Pros**: Keeps the main application interface cleaner. Allows more space for branding or instructions related to the sign-in process.
- **Cons**: Requires an extra step (redirection) for the user. Might feel less integrated if not styled consistently with the rest of the application.

#### Option 3: Modal/Dialog for Sign-In

- **Description**: Clicking a "Sign In" link (which could be less prominent initially, e.g., in a user menu) opens a modal dialog. This dialog contains the "Sign in with Google" button. The rest of the application remains visible but inactive in the background.
- **Pros**: Keeps the user on the current page, providing a less disruptive experience than a full redirect. Can be triggered from multiple points in the UI if needed.
- **Cons**: Modals can sometimes be intrusive. Requires careful implementation to ensure accessibility and proper focus management.

### Trade-offs and Use Cases

- **Simplicity vs. Integration**: Option 1 (Header Button) is often the most straightforward for users and integrates well into most applications. It's ideal if authentication is a primary action.
- **Unobtrusiveness vs. Steps**: Option 2 (Dedicated Page) is good if authentication is not always the first step, or if there's a need for more explanatory text. However, it adds an extra navigation step.
- **Contextual Sign-In**: Option 3 (Modal) can be effective if sign-in is offered as an optional enhancement or is contextually relevant (e.g., "Sign in to save your preferences"). It avoids navigating away from the current task.

For initial implementation, **Option 1 (Prominent Sign-In Button in Header)** is often a good starting point due to its clarity and common usage. It can be complemented by redirects to a sign-in page (Option 2) for unauthenticated access to protected routes.

### Decision

- **Recommended UI Treatment**: Option 1
- **Reasoning**: Clear and seemingly common.
