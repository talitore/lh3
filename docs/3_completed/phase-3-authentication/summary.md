The purpose of this feature was to implement user authentication using NextAuth.js, with Google as the initial OAuth provider. This allows users to sign into the application securely using their Google accounts and enables the protection of API routes based on their authentication status.

The project involved installing and configuring NextAuth.js, setting up a Google OAuth 2.0 client, and creating the necessary API route (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`) to handle authentication logic. Key design decisions included using the default JWT session strategy for stateless session management and adopting the `AUTH_` prefixed environment variables (e.g., `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`) for better forward compatibility. API routes are protected using `getServerSession` to ensure only authenticated users can access them, returning a 401 Unauthorized error otherwise.

The chosen UI treatment for sign-in is a prominent "Sign in with Google" button in the application header, which updates to show user information upon successful authentication, following a standard and user-friendly pattern. This setup provides a simple, lovable, and complete authentication system for the initial phase, focusing on Google OAuth.
