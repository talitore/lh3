### Feature Completion Summary: Phase 2.5 - Data Modeling & Schema

The purpose of this feature was to establish the foundational data structure for the application by defining the database schema using Prisma ORM. This involved creating models for `User`, `Run`, `RSVP`, and `Photo`, specifying their fields, data types, and relationships. Key relationships include users organizing multiple runs, runs having multiple RSVPs and photos, and users uploading photos.

What was built is a complete `schema.prisma` file detailing these models and their connections, including an `RSVPStatus` enum (`YES`, `NO`, `MAYBE`). Standard timestamp fields (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) were added to all models for better record tracking, superseding a previously considered `taggedAt` field for RSVPs. The implementation also involved successfully running database migrations to apply the schema and generating the Prisma client for type-safe database access in future backend development.

A notable functional result was the successful setup of the database schema and migration process. A minor challenge with Prisma's enum formatting was resolved by adopting a multi-line definition, ensuring the schema tools could process the definitions correctly. This phase provides the essential data layer upon which application features will be built.
