# Phase 6 Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document tracks detailed progress, technical decisions, and challenges encountered during the implementation of Phase 6 front-end pages and components.

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Navigation Pattern**: Confirmed use of enhanced sidebar navigation (Option 2 from spec)
- **RSVP Interface**: Implementing inline button group (Option A from spec)
- **Photo Gallery**: Grid layout with lightbox functionality (Option A from spec)
- **Component Structure**: Following existing shadcn/ui patterns and architecture guidelines

### Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Building components in order of dependency and user value
- **API Integration**: Leveraging existing endpoints without modifications
- **State Management**: Using React Context for global layout state, local state for components
- **Error Handling**: Following established patterns from existing codebase

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Requirements
- Strict mode compliance for all new code
- Proper interface definitions for all props and data structures
- Use of existing type definitions from Prisma schema

### Component Standards
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns and conventions
- Use proper forwardRef for wrapper components
- Implement proper error boundaries where needed
- Include proper ARIA labels and accessibility features

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for page-level functionality
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Responsive design testing across breakpoints

## Dependencies and Integrations

### Existing API Endpoints (Ready to Use)
- `GET /api/runs` - List runs with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/runs/[id]` - Get run details with attendees and photos
- `PUT /api/runs/[id]/rsvp` - Update user RSVP status
- `POST /api/runs/[id]/photos/generate-signed-url` - Generate S3 upload URL
- `POST /api/runs/[id]/photos/confirm-upload` - Confirm photo upload

### External Services
- Mapbox GL JS for interactive maps (already configured)
- AWS S3 for photo storage (already configured)
- NextAuth.js for authentication (already implemented)

### Database Schema
- User, Run, RSVP, Photo models already defined in Prisma
- Proper relationships and constraints in place
- Role-based access control implemented

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Lazy loading for photo galleries and heavy components
- Dynamic imports for admin tools to reduce initial bundle size
- React.memo for expensive components
- Proper image optimization with Next.js Image component

### Monitoring Points
- Page load times for run details and feed pages
- RSVP interaction response times
- Photo upload progress and success rates
- Mobile performance on slower devices

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Proper session validation for all protected actions
- Role-based access control for admin features
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### Data Validation
- Client-side validation with Zod schemas
- Server-side validation as backup
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
