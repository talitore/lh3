# Phase 4 API Endpoints - Summary

The Phase 4 API Endpoints feature established a comprehensive set of RESTful API endpoints to manage the core functionality of the application's "Runs" system. These endpoints enable the creation, retrieval, updating, and listing of runs, along with associated user interactions such as RSVPs, attendance tracking, and photo uploads. The API design follows RESTful principles with resource-oriented endpoints that provide clear, consistent interfaces for client applications.

Key design decisions include the implementation of enhanced filtering and pagination for run listings to ensure scalability, and the adoption of a signed URL approach for photo uploads that offloads bandwidth and processing from API servers to cloud storage (AWS S3). The API architecture prioritizes clarity, consistency, scalability, maintainability, security, and developer experience, following the SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete) principles. The implementation includes detailed specifications for AWS S3 setup for photo storage, including bucket configuration, CORS settings, and IAM permissions to ensure secure and efficient photo management.

This feature serves as a foundational layer for the application, providing a robust backend interface that client applications can leverage to deliver a seamless user experience for organizing and participating in runs, while ensuring the system can scale effectively as usage grows.
