## Open Questions

- Are there any preferences for specific versions of gems or packages beyond what's in the PRD? Nope
- What is the intended primary database for production (PostgreSQL is common with Rails, but not explicitly stated for prod in `phase-1-project-foundation-core-setup.md`)? PostgreSQL
- Any specific Kamal deployment targets or strategies to consider at this early stage? Not right now, note for later.
