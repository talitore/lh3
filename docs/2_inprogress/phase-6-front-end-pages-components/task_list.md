## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **High Priority**: Run details page, Feed page redesign, Enhanced sidebar
2. **Medium Priority**: Admin tools, Mobile optimization, Performance improvements
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced features, Documentation, Polish

### Technical Considerations
- Follow existing patterns from `docs/_reference/architecture.md`
- Use shadcn/ui components consistently
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- Use centralized constants from `src/lib/constants/`

### Dependencies
- Most tasks depend on existing API endpoints (already implemented)
- Photo upload depends on existing S3 integration
- Admin tools require role-based access control (already implemented)
- Real-time updates may require future WebSocket implementation
