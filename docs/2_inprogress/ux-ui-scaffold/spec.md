# UX/UI Scaffold Feature Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and technical specifications for the UX/UI Scaffold feature. The goal is to establish a robust and flexible foundation for the application's user interface and user experience.

## 2. Feature Breakdown

### 2.1. Global Layout

**Description:** Implement a consistent global layout structure for the application.
**Details:** - **Header:** - Contains the application logo. - Contains primary navigation links (e.g., "Feed", "Events", "Members"). - Potentially an "Admin Mode" toggle and User Profile icon/menu. - **Sidebar:** - Contains secondary navigation or contextual tools. - Initial sections: "Upcoming Events," "Quick Stats," "Admin Tools." - The sidebar should be collapsible/expandable. - **Main Content Area:** - Flexible area to display page-specific content (e.g., a feed of posts, event details, member lists). - **Footer (Optional but Recommended):** - Contains copyright information, links to terms of service, privacy policy.

**Technical Scope:** - Create a main layout component (e.g., `app/layout.tsx`). - Utilize CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout structure. - Ensure responsiveness across common device breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### 2.2. Design System

**Description:** Define and implement a foundational design system.
**Details:** - **Extend Shadcn's Tailwind Tokens:** - Define a primary color palette (e.g., brand color, accent colors). - Define secondary color palettes (e.g., success, warning, error, info). - Define a spacing scale (e.g., for margins, paddings, gaps). - Define typography styles (headings, body text, links). - **Common Reusable Components:** - `Card`: For displaying contained pieces of information. - Props: `title` (optional), `children`, `className` (optional). - `Badge`: For small status indicators or labels. - Props: `variant` (e.g., 'info', 'success', 'warning', 'danger'), `children`, `className` (optional). - `Button`: For user actions. - Props: `variant` (e.g., 'primary', 'secondary', 'outline', 'ghost', 'link'), `size` (e.g., 'sm', 'md', 'lg'), `onClick`, `children`, `disabled` (optional), `icon` (optional), `className` (optional). - `Input`: For text-based user input. - Props: `type` (e.g., 'text', 'email', 'password', 'number'), `placeholder` (optional), `value`, `onChange`, `disabled` (optional), `iconLeft` (optional), `iconRight` (optional), `className` (optional). - `MapEmbed`: For embedding interactive maps (e.g., Google Maps, Leaflet). - Props: `src` (or coordinates/API key depending on service), `zoomLevel`, `markers` (optional), `className` (optional). - `PhotoGallery`: For displaying a collection of images. - Props: `images` (array of image URLs/objects), `layout` (e.g., 'grid', 'carousel'), `onClickImage` (optional), `className` (optional).

**Technical Scope:** - Configure Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.js`) with extended tokens. - Create individual React components for each item listed above. - Components should be styled using Tailwind CSS. - Components should be designed with accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation) in mind.

### 2.3. Prototyping & Development Workflow

**Description:** Establish a clear workflow for creating, testing, and integrating new UI components.
**Details:** - **Component Sandbox:** - Create a dedicated area in the application (e.g., `/app/(demo)/components/`) to showcase and test each new UI component in isolation. - Each component should have a page demonstrating its various states and props. - **Storybook (Optional):** - Evaluate the need and benefit of integrating Storybook for more comprehensive component documentation and isolated development. If deemed beneficial, set up Storybook.

**Technical Scope:** - Create routes and pages for the component sandbox. - If Storybook is adopted, install and configure it.

## 3. UI Treatment Options (Global Layout)

Based on common best practices, here are three UI treatment options for the global layout:

### Option 1: Classic (Fixed Sidebar)

- **Header:** Standard height, always visible at the top. Contains logo and primary navigation.
- **Sidebar:** Fixed width on the left, always visible on desktop. Collapses to a hamburger menu on tablet/mobile. Contains "Upcoming," "Stats," "Admin Tools."
- **Main Content:** Occupies the remaining space.
- **Pros:** Familiar, good for applications with many top-level navigation items in the sidebar that need to be persistently accessible.
- **Cons:** Can feel a bit rigid if sidebar content isn't always relevant. Reduces horizontal space for main content.

### Option 2: Modern (Collapsible Overlay Sidebar)

- **Header:** Standard height, always visible. Contains logo, primary navigation, and a hamburger icon to toggle the sidebar.
- **Sidebar:** Initially hidden. Slides in as an overlay from the left (or right) when toggled. Contains "Upcoming," "Stats," "Admin Tools."
- **Main Content:** Takes full width when the sidebar is collapsed.
- **Pros:** Maximizes content area. Cleaner look when sidebar is not needed. Good for touch devices.
- **Cons:** Sidebar content is not immediately visible; requires an extra click.

### Option 3: Hybrid (Top Navigation for Main Sections, Contextual Sidebar)

- **Header:** Slightly taller, contains logo and primary navigation (e.g., "Feed," "Upcoming," "Stats"). A secondary row or section within the header might hold user profile/settings.
- **Sidebar:** Used for contextual actions or sub-navigation related to the current main section (e.g., if in "Admin Tools," sidebar shows specific admin sub-sections). Can be fixed or collapsible. If "Admin Tools" is a primary nav item, this option might merge with Option 1 or 2 for that section.
- **Main Content:** Occupies the main area.
- **Pros:** Clear separation of primary and secondary navigation. Can adapt well to different application sections.
- **Cons:** Header can become crowded. Might require more complex navigation logic.

**Recommendation:** Start with **Option 2 (Modern)** for its flexibility and focus on content, but ensure the sidebar is easily discoverable. The "Admin Tools" section might warrant a more persistent sub-navigation (sidebar) once that section is active, potentially blending into an Option 1 style for that specific area.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Layout and components should load quickly.
- **Responsiveness:** UI must adapt gracefully to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Accessibility (A11y):** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines where feasible. Components should be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be well-organized, commented where necessary, and easy to understand and modify.
- **Extensibility:** The design system and layout should be easy to extend with new components and features.

## 5. Out of Scope

- Specific content for "Upcoming," "Stats," or "Admin Tools" beyond basic placeholder structure.
- User authentication and authorization logic.
- Data fetching and backend integration for the components (components will be built with placeholder/static data initially).
- Detailed visual design and branding (focus is on structure and foundational components).

## 6. Open Questions/Future Considerations

- Finalize the exact list of primary navigation items for the header (current thought: "Feed", "Events", "Members"). This is fine for now.
- Determine the specific icons to be used for navigation items and within components (e.g., icons for "Upcoming Events", "Stats", "Admin Tools", and specific admin actions like "Attendance Tracking"). Use whatever makes sense. I'm indifferent.
- Further define the interaction model for the MapEmbed and PhotoGallery components (e.g., zoom behavior, image click actions). Default behaviors all around.
- Decision on Storybook integration. Fuck storybook. I want nothing to do with it.
