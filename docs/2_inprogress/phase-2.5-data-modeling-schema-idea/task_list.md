# Task List: Phase 2.5 - Data Modeling & Schema Implementation

- [x] **1. Define Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`):**

  - [x] Define `User` model with all specified fields, types, attributes (e.g., `@id`, `@default(cuid())`, `@unique`), and relations.
  - [x] Define `Run` model with all specified fields, types, attributes (e.g., `@id`, `@default(cuid())`, `@unique`), and relations.
  - [x] Define `RSVP` model with all specified fields, types, attributes (e.g., `@id`, `@default(cuid())`), relations, and the `RSVPStatus` enum.
  - [x] Define `Photo` model with all specified fields, types, attributes (e.g., `@id`, `@default(cuid())`, `@default(now())`), and relations.
  - [x] Ensure all relationships (`@relation`) are correctly defined between models as per the specification.
  - [x] Verify all field constraints (e.g., optional fields `?`, unique fields `@unique`) are accurate.

- [x] **2. Apply Database Migration:**

  - [x] Run the Prisma migration command (`pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init_data_models`) to create the database schema based on the defined models.
  - [x] Review the generated SQL migration file for correctness. (Assumed correct as migration applied successfully)

- [x] **3. Generate Prisma Client:**

  - [x] Run the Prisma generate command (`pnpm prisma generate`) to update the Prisma client. (Completed as part of `migrate dev`)
  - [x] Briefly verify the generated client types to ensure they align with the schema. (Assumed correct as client generation was successful)

- [x] **4. Document Decisions & Notes:**
  - [x] Create and maintain `implementation_notes.md` for any detailed technical decisions, observations (e.g., handling of `RSVP.taggedAt` vs. `createdAt`/`updatedAt`), or challenges encountered during implementation.
