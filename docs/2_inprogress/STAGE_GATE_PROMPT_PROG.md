Stage Gate Prompt: Implementation Kick-off

Context: A feature folder, including planning documents, has been moved into
the implementation stage and the folder is referenced in this chat

Instructions:

Gain Context:

- Review the reference docs to understand the context of repo.
  - [repomix](../../repomix-output.xml)

1.  Analyze Plan: Read and understand the contents of the feature folder,
    focusing on `README.md`, `spec.md`, and `design.md`.
2.  Generate Task List: Based on the spec, the decision within the spec, and the design, generate a high-level
    checklist of the main implementation tasks required to build this feature.
    Phrase tasks clearly (e.g., "Set up database schema changes",
    "Build API endpoint for X", "Create frontend component Y", "Write unit tests for Z").
    Save that task list into the attached folder as task_list.md, which you will mark off as you complete each task.
3.  Suggest Tracking: Recommend creating an `implementation_notes.md`
    file within the feature folder to track detailed progress, technical
    decisions, challenges encountered.
4.  Output: Provide the generated task checklist and the suggestion for creating `implementation_notes.md`.

Note
Once you have created the plan, then go ahead and implement this, I expect this
to be a long chain of requests and that you will use a number of tool calls to
achieve this.

When completed, direct the user to the next logical step for them to get this feature implemented.
