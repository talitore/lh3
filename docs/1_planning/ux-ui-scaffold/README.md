# UX/UI Scaffold Feature

## Goal

The goal of this feature is to establish a foundational UI/UX structure for the application. This includes setting up a global layout, defining a design system with reusable components, and creating a process for prototyping and developing new UI elements.

## Key Requirements

- Define a global application layout (header, sidebar, main content area).
- Extend a base design system (e.g., shadcn's Tailwind tokens) with custom colors and spacing.
- Create a set of common, reusable UI components: Card, Badge, Button, Input, MapEmbed, PhotoGallery.
- Establish a workflow for building and testing UI components, potentially using Storybook or dedicated demo pages.

## Target Audience

- Developers building and maintaining the application.
- Designers working on the application's look and feel.

## Open Questions

- Should Storybook be a mandatory part of the component development workflow, or will sandbox pages suffice initially? Fuck storybook. Sandbox pages suffice.
- What are the specific navigation items for the header and sidebar? "Feed", "Events", "Members".
- Are there any existing brand guidelines or specific theming requirements to consider for the design system extension? No.
