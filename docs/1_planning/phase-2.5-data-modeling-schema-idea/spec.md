### Feature Functionality and Technical Scope

This feature involves defining the database schema using Prisma ORM. The scope includes:

1.  **Model Definitions:** Defining the structure for `User`, `Run`, `RSVP`, and `Photo` entities, including their fields, types, and attributes (e.g., `@id`, `@default(cuid())`, `@unique`, `@relation`).
2.  **Relationships:** Establishing one-to-many and many-to-many (implicitly through join tables if Prisma handles it, or explicitly if needed) relationships between these models.
    - `User` to `Run` (one-to-many: a user organizes multiple runs).
    - `User` to `RSVP` (one-to-many: a user has multiple RSVPs).
    - `Run` to `RSVP` (one-to-many: a run has multiple RSVPs).
    - `Run` to `Photo` (one-to-many: a run has multiple photos).
    - `User` to `Photo` (one-to-many: a user uploads multiple photos).
3.  **Enums:** Defining the `RSVPStatus` enum.
4.  **Database Migration:** Generating and applying database migrations based on the schema changes.
5.  **Prisma Client Generation:** Generating the Prisma client for type-safe database access in the application code.

### UI Treatments/Layout Options (for Data Visualization/Management - Conceptual)

Since this is a backend data modeling phase, direct UI for _this specific feature_ (i.e., schema definition) is primarily through the Prisma schema file itself and command-line tools. However, we can conceptualize UI treatments for _managing or visualizing_ the data that this schema will hold.

**Option 1: Table-Based Admin Interface**

- **Description:** A traditional admin dashboard view where each model (`User`, `Run`, `RSVP`, `Photo`) is represented as a filterable, sortable table. Forms would be used for creating/editing entries.
- **Layout:**
  - Navigation sidebar listing data models.
  - Main content area displaying the selected model's data in a table.
  - Buttons for "Add New User", "Add New Run", etc.
  - Inline actions for edit/delete per row.
- **Pros:** Familiar, straightforward for CRUD operations, easy to implement with many admin panel generators.
- **Cons:** Can be less intuitive for understanding relationships between data, might be overwhelming if data grows large.

**Option 2: ERD-Like Visual Interface (Read-Only/Light Edits)**

- **Description:** A UI that visually represents the schema like an Entity-Relationship Diagram. Users could click on entities to see sample data or navigate relationships.
- **Layout:**
  - Canvas displaying model boxes and lines showing relationships.
  - Clicking a model could open a modal/sidebar with its fields and some example entries.
  - Potentially allows for very simple data modifications or additions directly from the visual.
- **Pros:** Excellent for understanding schema structure and relationships, good for onboarding new developers.
- **Cons:** More complex to build, primarily for visualization rather than heavy data management.

**Option 3: Contextual Data Views Integrated into App Features**

- **Description:** Instead of a separate admin UI for raw data, data is managed contextually within the application's features. For example, managing `Run` details happens on a "Run Details Page," RSVPs are managed via event pages, etc.
- **Layout:** Varies greatly depending on the specific application feature. For example:
  - A "Run Creation Form" would directly interact with the `Run` and potentially `User` models.
  - An "Event Page" would display `Run` info and allow users to RSVP (interacting with `RSVP` model).
- **Pros:** Most user-friendly for end-users (if applicable) or app administrators performing specific tasks, data management is integrated into workflows.
- **Cons:** Doesn't provide a centralized place to view/manage _all_ raw data or debug schema-related issues easily for developers.

### Decision Point

For initial development and backend administration, **Option 1 (Table-Based Admin Interface)** is often the most practical starting point for developers to quickly manage and verify data. This can be complemented by **Option 3** for user-facing interactions.

Which approach or combination of approaches should be prioritized for internal data management and debugging during development?
