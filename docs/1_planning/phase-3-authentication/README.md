### Goal

Implement user authentication using NextAuth, initially with Google as an OAuth provider, and protect API routes based on authentication status.

### Key Requirements

- Install and configure NextAuth.
- Implement Google OAuth provider.
- Secure API routes using `getServerSession` to allow access only to authenticated users.

### Target Audience

- Developers (integrating the authentication system)
- End users (who will use the authentication system to access the application)

### Open Questions

- Are there any specific UI/UX guidelines for the sign-in process beyond standard practices? No
- Will any other authentication providers be required in the near future (e.g., GitHub, email/password)? email/password possibly needed
- Are there specific API routes that should _not_ be protected initially? No
