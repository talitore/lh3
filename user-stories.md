  - **And** the user optionally enters an "Intro Link" (URL).
  - **And** the user provides a location by:
    - Typing an address into the "Address" `AddressAutocomplete` field, which upon selection populates the address string and hidden latitude/longitude.
    - Or, by dragging the marker on the `MapPicker` component, which updates the hidden latitude/longitude.
  - **And** the user clicks the "Create Run" button.
  - **Then** a `POST` request is made to the `/api/runs` endpoint with the form data (number, descriptor, ISO dateTime, address, lat, lng, introLink, and implicitly the logged-in user as organizerId).
  - **And** if successful, the user is redirected to the newly created run's detail page (`/runs/{newRun.id}`).
  - **And** if there's an error (e.g., run number already exists as per `runService` P2002 error for `Run_number_key`), an alert with an error message is shown.
- **User Story 13: Edit an Existing Run (Organizer Only)**
  - **Given** an authenticated user who is the organizer of the run is viewing the run's detail page (`/runs/[id]`)
  - **When** the user clicks the "Edit Run" button

  - **And** "Save Changes" and "Cancel" buttons should appear.
  - **When** the user modifies the editable fields and clicks "Save Changes"
  - **Then** a `PUT` request is made to `/api/runs/[id]` with the updated data.
  - **And** the run details are updated in the database (via `runService.updateRun`).
  - **And** the page should revert to view mode, displaying the updated information.
  - **When** the user is in edit mode and clicks "Cancel"
  - **Then** any changes made in the input fields are discarded (form resets to original run data), and the page reverts to view mode.

**RSVP & Attendance:**

- **User Story 14: RSVP to a Run (Authenticated User)**
  - **Given** an authenticated user is viewing an upcoming run (either on the feed `RunCard` or the run detail page `/runs/[id]`)
  - **When** the user clicks one of the RSVP buttons ("Yes", "Maybe", "No")
  - **Then** an API call is made to update/create their RSVP status for that run (likely to `/api/runs/[id]/rsvp` which uses `rsvpService.upsertRsvp`).
  - **And** the UI optimistically updates the RSVP counts displayed for the run and reflects the user's selected RSVP status.
- **User Story 15: View RSVP Counts and Attendee List on Run Detail Page**
  - **Given** a user is on a run's detail page (`/runs/[id]`)
  - **When** the page loads with run data (from `runService.getRunById` which includes RSVPs)
  - **Then** the user should see a summary of RSVP counts (e.g., "X Yes, Y Maybe, Z No").
  - **And** the user should see a list of users who have RSVP'd "Yes", grouped under a "Going" heading.
  - **And** the user should see a list of users who have RSVP'd "Maybe", grouped under a "Maybe" heading.
  - **And** the user should see an expandable section for users who have RSVP'd "No", initially collapsed, showing the count.
- **User Story 16: Check-in to a Run on Event Day (Authenticated User)**
  - **Given** an authenticated user is on a run's detail page (`/runs/[id]`)
  - **And** it is the day of the run (`isEventDay()` is true).
  - **And** it is within the allowed check-in window (e.g., 30 minutes before to 2 hours after start time - `isEventTime()` is true).
  - **When** the user clicks the "Check In" button.
  - **Then** a `POST` request is made to `/api/runs/[id]/checkin` (which uses `attendanceService.markAttendance` with the logged-in user's ID).
  - **And** the UI should update to show "You're checked in!" with a success icon.
  - **And** the check-in button becomes unavailable or indicates checked-in status.
  - **Given** check-in is not yet available (e.g., too early)
  - **Then** the button should be disabled and display "Check-In Not Yet Available".

**Photos:**

- **User Story 17: View Recent Photos on Feed**
  - **Given** a user is on the main feed/homepage (`/`)
  - **When** the page loads, and recent photos are fetched (from `/api/photos/recent`)
  - **Then** the user should see a grid (e.g., 6 photos) of recent photos, each showing the image, run number, and uploader name on hover/focus.
- **User Story 18: View Photo Gallery for a Specific Run**
  - **Given** a user is on a run's detail page (`/runs/[id]`)
  - **When** the page loads run data, including associated photos (from `runService.getRunById`)
  - **Then** the user should see a "Photos" section with a gallery (`PhotoGallery` component) displaying all photos uploaded for that run.
- **User Story 19: Upload Photo to a Run (Authenticated User)**
  - **Given** an authenticated user is on a run's detail page (`/runs/[id]`) and the `PhotoGallery` component allows uploads.
  - **When** the user initiates an upload (e.g., selects a file via an upload button within the gallery).
  - **Then** the client requests a signed URL from the backend (e.g., `/api/runs/[id]/photos/generate-signed-url` with filename and content type, which uses `photoService.generateSignedUrlForUpload`).
  - **And** the backend creates a preliminary photo record and returns a signed S3 URL and a `photoId`.
  - **And** the client uses this signed URL to upload the image file directly to S3.
  - **And** upon successful S3 upload, the client notifies the backend to confirm the upload (e.g., `/api/runs/[id]/photos/confirm-upload` with `photoId` and optional caption, which uses `photoService.confirmPhotoUpload`).
  - **And** the backend updates the photo record with the final S3 URL and caption.
  - **And** the newly uploaded photo (with caption) appears in the `PhotoGallery` on the run detail page.

**Community & Information:**

- **User Story 20: View Community Statistics on Feed**
  - **Given** a user is on the main feed/homepage (`/`)

  - **Then** the user should be presented with information about Hash House Harrier traditions, what to bring, and what to expect (content within `WhatsHashingInfo`).
